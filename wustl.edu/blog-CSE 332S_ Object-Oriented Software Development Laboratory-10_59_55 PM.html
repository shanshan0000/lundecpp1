<hr><p> <h2><a name="Course Description">Course Description</a></h2>
This course will expose you to the syntax, semantics, and standard
libraries of the C++ language; to common C++ design and implementation
idioms; and to many opportunities to apply the knowledge and idioms you
learn through hands-on studio exercises and projects in C++.<p>
All programming in this course will be done in C++, a language in
which you can combine the object-oriented, procedural, and generic
programming ideas with which you'll gain experience throughout the
semester. Since many students enter this course with experience in
Java but not C++, the early portion of the syllabus is designed to
give you a breadth-first experience of the major capabilities and
features of C++ and to assist your progress up the rest of the C++
learning curve. In addition to providing a reasonable coverage of the
C++ language overall, this course also will focus on new features
recently introduced to C++ and its libraries, particularly those from
the C++11 standard.<p>
<hr><p>
<h2><a name=Prerequisites>Prerequisites</a></h2>
<ul>
 <li>CSE 132 (Computer Science II) or CSE 241 (Algorithms and Data Structures). If you have not
 taken either of these courses yet you should take at least one of them before taking CSE 332,
 especially since we will assume you have at least 2 or 3 previous semesters of programming
 proficiency before enrolling in this course. 
 <li>Proficiency with Java (<em>e.g.</em>, from CSE 131 and 132), C, C++, or other 
 general-purpose industrial-strength programming language.
</ul>
<hr><p>
<h2><a name="Times and Locations">Times and Locations</a></h2>
Discussions: Tuesdays and Thursdays 10am (Section 1) or 11:30 (Section 2) in Urbauer 218<br>
Studios: Tuesdays and Thursdays after the discussion until the end of class. 
 <br>
Additional TA help sessions: times and locations TBA<br>
<p>
The first class meeting will be on Tuesday January 13 in Urbauer 218.
Following a presentation of the course structure and syllabus that
day, we will also make sure each student's login works on the Windows
machines in Urbauer 218, and address any problems that may occur.<p>
After that introductory meeting, at each 90 minute class meeting on
Tuesdays and Thursdays (except for the dates of the midterm and final
reviews and exams), discussions will be held in Urbauer 218 and will consist
of about 30 minutes of presentation and discussion of the main issues
to consider for that day's topic, followed by a hands-on studio
session for the remaining time that day in Urbauer 218. The review sessions prior
to the midterm and final exams also will be held in Urbauer 218, but will
occupy most to all of the session (and there will not be any studio
exercises assigned on those days).<p>
The instructors and teaching assistants will read and respond to
postings on the <a href=#Messageboard> course message board</a> (<a href=http://bb.wustl.edu/>http://bb.wustl.edu/</a>).<p>
<hr><p>
<h2><a name=Messageboard>Message Board</a></h2>
Please submit <strong>ALL</strong> questions, and concerns of public
nature, to the class message board (<a href=http://bb.wustl.edu/>http://bb.wustl.edu/</a>).
Please also answer other people's questions on the message board!<p>
<p><strong><b><font size=4 color=red>Please do not e-mail
technical questions to your professor 
 or teaching assistants
individually: instead, please post on the message board for all
to see, consider, and respond.</font></b></strong></p>
<p>Please note that the message board is a vital part of
your CSE 332 experience. <b><font size=4>Participation in the
message board (<em>i.e.</em>, quantity and quality of your posts) may
be considered in your participation grade (and your completion and submission
of studio exercises will be the baseline from which the participation grade
is calculated).</font></b></p>
If you have any trouble with your accounts, accessing blackboard and/or the course message
board, etc., please let us know <strong>right away</strong>!<p>
<hr><p> <h2><a name=Sessions>Discussion/Studio Sessions</a></h2> The
discussions and studio sessions will emphasize three main themes: C++
language syntax and semantics; procedural, object-oriented and generic
programming techniques; and mastery of useful design, programming, and
debugging techniques and tools.<p>
In addition to class meeting dates and topics, assigned readings in
the required textbook will be provided as we go through the
semester.<p>
Although the sequence of topics listed is a good guide to the course
content overall, it may be adjusted somewhat as the semester
progresses to emphasize, de-emphasize, or inter-relate certain topics
depending on the progress and interests of the students in the course.
If you are finding a given topic very easy or very difficult, please
let your instructors know.<p>

<hr><p> <h2><a name=Labs>Labs</a></h2> There will be 5 lab
assignments in this course. The labs will increase in difficulty and
value throughout the semester.<p>
Labs are to be submitted electronically, and will be graded and
returned to you electronically as well. Each lab submission requires
a separate <code>ReadMe.txt</code> file containing a lab report
writeup. Each assigment web page will describe the procedure for
submitting the lab, along with the report format and content
requirements. Use of this process is required.<p>
Labs 0, 1, and 2 are to be completed individually, though on labs 3 and 4 you
will have the option of working in teams of 2 or 3 people. You should
please submit your code and a lab report for each lab sufficiently
ahead of its advertised due date and time (shown on the lab assignment
web page) that normal e-mail delays etc. do not result in your lab
being received late (according to the time stamp put on the e-mail by
the CEC e-mail server used by the cse332 account).<p>
Labs received within 24 hours after the posted deadline will be
accepted with a 10% penalty up front, and labs submitted between 24
and 48 hours after the posted deadline will be accepted with a 20%
penalty up front. Labs submitted after that will not be graded,
except in the case of <strong>documented</strong> extenuating
circumstances.<p>
Extensions may be granted in advance on a case-by-case basis as long
as the circumstances warrant an extension and the request is made
sufficiently ahead of the deadline. Extensions will not be granted
after the deadline except in very special cases (such as documented
medical emergencies).<p>
You may discuss general questions related your projects with other
students, the TAs, and your instructors during studio hours. For
additional help please contact your TAs or instructors.
 
While you are encouraged to
 
ask for help on particular problems you may encounter during
a project, you must design and implement your own solutions, and
prepare your own reports. In particular, while discussion of small code
fragments related to specific questions is allowed and encouraged,
direct sharing, viewing, or other "reuse" of complete code files
(especially if done covertly) is strictly forbidden. If you're not
sure whether or not sharing a given section of code is ok, please ask
your instructors' permission before doing so.<p>
The following labs have been assigned so far in the course:
<ul>
 <li><a href=https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse332/lab0/index.html>Lab 0</a> (assigned Tue Jan 13, due 11:59pm Tue Jan 27)
 <li><a href=https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse332/lab1/index.html>Lab 1</a> (assigned Tue Jan 27, due 11:59pm Tue Feb 10)
 <li><a href=https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse332/lab2/index.html>Lab 2</a> (assigned Wed Feb 11, due 11:59pm Tue Mar 3)
 <li><a href=https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse332/lab3/index.html>Lab 3</a> (assigned Mon Mar 16, due 11:59pm Sun Apr 5)
 <li><a href=https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse332/lab4/index.html>Lab 4</a> (assigned Mon Apr 6, due 11:59pm Sun Apr 26)
</ul><p>
<hr><p> <h2><a name="Coding Standards">Coding Standards</a></h2> Many
organizations impose coding standards on programmers, and these
standards can range from general principles to very specific
requirements. In this class, part of the grade for each programming
assignment will be based on the <a href=https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse332/Guidelines.html> CSE 332
Programming Guidelines</a>, which are intended to build good
programming habits that will help avoid common mistakes and help make
your programs more readable and better organized and documented. As
the course progresses, we'll point out relevant ones for each
programming assignment, so please re-review it before starting each new
programming assignment.<p>
<hr><p>
<h2><a name=Textbook>Textbooks and Other Resources</a></h2>
In addition to class meeting dates and topics, assigned readings in the 
following required textbook are shown for each of the class meetings:
<ul>
 <li><b><font size=4>[LLM] Stanley B. Lippman, Jose Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo, </font><font size=4>C++ Primer,
 Fifth Edition, ISBN 0321714113</font>
 <font size=4>, </font>
 <font size=4>Prentice Hall</font></b><b><font size=4>, 2012.</font></b>
</ul><p>
 
In addition to the required textbook, the following texts may be
useful and interesting additions to your programming library:
<ul>
 <li>Austern, Matthew H., <em>Generic Programming and the STL</em>,
 <a href=http://www.aw.com/>Addison-Wesley</a>, 1998.
 <li>Beck, Kent, <em>Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change</em>,
 <a href=http://www.aw.com/>Addison-Wesley</a>, 1999.
 <li>Kernighan and Ritchie, <em>C Programming Language</em>, 2nd Ed., 1988.
 <a href=http://www.aw.com/>Addison-Wesley</a>, 2005.
 <li>Bjarne Stroustrup,
 <em>The C++ Programming Language: Fourth Edition,</em>
 Addison-Wesley, 2013.
</ul><p>
On-line information sources (please feel free to suggest other good ones):
<ul>

<h2><a name=Grading>Grading</a></h2>
As a rough guideline, 90-100 has historically been the <strong>A</strong> range,
80-89 the <strong>B</strong> range, and so on, though depending on the
complete distribution the specific grade division points (and addition of + or - qualifiers
to the grades near the boundaries) may vary.<p>
For students taking the course pass/fail, a passing grade will be
equivalent to a D or better in the course.<p>
See the <a href=#Labs>Labs</a> section for a discussion of the labs
and how they will be graded.<p>
The midterm and final exams will be comprehensive: each potentially
may cover any of the material up to that point in the course. The
best way to study for the exams is to keep up with the studio
exercises and programming assignments, and to ask lots of questions in
the studio sessions
throughout the semester.<p>
The last grading component is an evaluation of your participation
in the class, and of your application of the tools
and techniques discussed in class and labs. This component is
separated out to:
<ol>
 <li>broaden the evaluation criteria,
 <li>reduce the weight of the exams a bit, and
 <li>encourage active participation in discussions/studios.
</ol><p>
Percentage completion of the studio exercises (including posting
answers to them) will be used as the baseline for evaluating
participation grades, though other factors such as attendance and
engagement in discussion and studio sessions also may be considered if
they differ significantly.

<h2><a name=Cheating>Cheating</a></h2>
Cheating is the misrepresentation of someone else's work as your own,
or assisting someone else in cheating, and will not be tolerated in
this course.<p>
For this course, examples of cheating include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>providing or receiving answers or other assistance during an exam, 
<li>accessing unapproved sources of information during an exam,
<li>submitting program code written outside this course this semester 
 or by another person not on your team, without specific prior approval by the instructors,
<li>allowing another student not on your team to copy (or helping them reconstruct) essentially 
 the same solution your team has developed for a programming assignment.
</ul>
<p>
This is a very serious matter. Anyone found cheating will at a
minimum <strong>lose</strong> points equal to the assigned value for
the assignment in question (for example if an assignment were worth
10% of the course grade then -10% of the course grade would be
assigned), or possibly receive an F for the course. Further action
may be taken in extreme cases, possibly including referral to the
School of Engineering and Applied Science's formal academic integrity
review process.<p>
Furthermore, our policy is that we will make the final determination
on what constitutes cheating. If you suspect that you may be entering
an ambiguous situation, it is your responsibility to clarify it before
we detect it. If in doubt, please ask.<p>
To ensure this policy is implemented consistently and fairly, and that
any problems are detected and addressed as early as possible, we may
make use of automated program similarity checkers to assess uniqueness
and independence of submitted program solutions.<p>
